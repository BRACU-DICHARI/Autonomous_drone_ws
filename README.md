### NAVIGATION SYSTEM :flying_saucer:

The following components were used for the navigation system:

* [NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developer Kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B084DSDDLT/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)<br>
* [Wireless-AC8265 - Dual-mode wireless NIC module for Jetson Nano Developer Kit M.2 NGFF](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SM4SPLV/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)<br>
* [Intel RealSense - Depth camera D435i](https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Intel-RealSense-profundidad-plateado-82635D435IDK5P/dp/B07MWR2YJB/ref=sr_1_2?__mk_es_US=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&keywords=D435i&qid=1636746456&sr=8-2)<br>

An MDF structure is built to attach these elements to the drone and thus make use of the integration of all these technologies. 

The system aspect of the experimental drone is as follows.

A simple navigation system is developed directing the UAV to a previously defined terrestrial coordinate. The navigation script is in charge of taking off, orienting, moving and landing the drone to the destination point.

For the navigation to run it was necessary to create other scripts that run in parallel as ROS nodes in the Python framework and these are:
